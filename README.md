# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis assignment analyzing the [COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyasingh900/covid19-dataset) using Python in Google Colab. The project loads, explores, and visualizes COVID-19 data (columns: Date, Country/Region, Confirmed, Deaths, etc.) to uncover global case trends. Tasks include data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations (line, bar, histogram, scatter plots).

## Repository Structure
- Data_Analysis_Assignment.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the analysis code and findings.
- (Optional) Additional files: Future branches may include updated notebooks or scripts.

## Setup
- *Environment*: Google Colab (no local Python libraries needed).
- *Dataset*: Download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyasingh900/covid19-dataset) via kagglehub in Colab.
- *Libraries*: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (pre-installed in Colab).

## How to Create a Branch on GitHub
Branches allow you to work on changes (e.g., new plots) without affecting the main branch. Follow these steps to create a branch using the GitHub website:

1. *Access the Repository*:
   - Go to [github.com/your-username/covid-data-analysis](https://github.com/your-username/covid-data-analysis).
   - Ensure you’re signed in to GitHub.

2. *Open the Branch Dropdown*:
   - Above the file list, click the dropdown labeled main (default branch).

3. *Create a New Branch*:
   - In the dropdown, type a branch name (e.g., analysis-update) in the *Find or create a branch…* field.
   - Press *Enter* or click *Create branch: analysis-update*.

4. *Verify the Branch*:
   - The dropdown now shows analysis-update. You’re on the new branch.
   - Changes (e.g., editing Data_Analysis_Assignment.ipynb) will save to this branch, not main.

5. *Make Changes (Optional)*:
   - Click a file (e.g., Data_Analysis_Assignment.ipynb).
   - Click the pencil icon to edit (e.g., add a comment).
   - Commit with a message (e.g., “Update notebook”) to the analysis-update branch.

6. *Switch Back to Main (Optional)*:
   - Click the branch dropdown and select main to return to the main branch.

## Next Steps
- Run the notebook in Colab to reproduce the analysis.
- Create branches for new features (e.g., add a correlation heatmap).
- Merge branches to main when changes are complete (see GitHub’s merge guide).
